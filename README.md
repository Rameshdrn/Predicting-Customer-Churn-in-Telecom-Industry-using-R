# Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-Telecom-Industry-using-R

**# Telecommunication Company Churn Analysis**

A project for BUAN 6337.501 by Group Members: Noel Abraham, Ramesh Dasari, Rohan Srivastava, Saurav Gupta, and Vaibhav Gupta

**## Introduction**

This project focuses on churn analysis in a telecommunication company, aiming to predict whether a customer will leave or continue their telecom service. The analysis also aims to identify the most relevant features contributing to churn. The dataset used contains various customer parameters and is analyzed to provide actionable insights for the business.

**## Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
- Analyze customer churn and its impact on the telecom service.
- Predict whether a customer is likely to churn.
- Identify the key features influencing churn.
- Provide recommendations to reduce churn and increase profitability.

**## Data Overview and Preprocessing**

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and contains 7043 observations with 21 attributes. It includes various customer details, service-related information, and churn status. The data was preprocessed, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

**## Exploratory Analysis**

Exploratory analysis was performed to understand the dataset's distribution and uncover patterns related to customer demographics and service choices. The analysis helped identify factors that contribute to churn, such as tenure, monthly charges, and service types.

**## Predictive Analysis**

The project includes predictive models such as logistic regression, probit regression, and a random forest classifier to estimate customer churn. The Random Forest model provided the highest accuracy in predicting churn.

**## Conclusion & Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, the project concludes with several recommendations to reduce customer churn and enhance profitability. Recommendations include implementing a tiered loyalty program, offering contractual discounts, improving customer service quality, and providing better network infrastructure.
